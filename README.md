4. **Transaction Handling**: Users can perform transactions, such as deposits, withdrawals, and transfers between accounts. The app ensures data integrity and accuracy during these operations.

5. **Audit Trail**: Every transaction is recorded with relevant details, creating an audit trail for future reference and accountability.

6. **Reports and Analytics**: Generate reports related to account balances, transaction history, and customer details. Analytics tools help gain insights into the bank's performance.
